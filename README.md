# fingerprint-machine-learning-model-evaluation
This repository contains various machine learning models used for classification of foreground and background of fingerprint images. 
# Dataset Creation
made 21x21 image patches on the fingerprint images
created dataset on these image patches based on glcm features
# Model Evaluation 
applied various classification models on the dataset and results were graphically plotted
# performance chart
